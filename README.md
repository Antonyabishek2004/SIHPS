## Problem Title 
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases

## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
The e-Portal for the CMH will offer various functionalities to ensure smooth case management, enabling stakeholders to access up-to-date information and efficiently conduct legal proceedings. The system will incorporate a wide array of features, including:

1 Filing of Case: A digital interface for filing cases online, allowing legal practitioners and concerned parties to submit cases electronically.

2 Caveat Matching: Automatic matching of filed cases with existing caveats to notify concerned parties when a related case is filed.

3 Case Allocation: An automated system for the efficient allocation of cases to judges or benches.

4 Daily Case Proceedings: A section to record daily case proceedings, including hearings, orders passed, and other relevant activities.

5 Notice Generation: Automatic generation of notices related to case hearings and other procedural requirements.

6 Case Transfer: A feature to facilitate the seamless transfer of cases between courts or benches when needed.

7 Case Status Search: A search functionality enabling users to query the status of cases by various parameters (e.g., case number, party name, judge).

8 Reports: Automated generation of reports for analysis of case details, pendency, disposal rates, etc.
